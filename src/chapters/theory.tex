\section{Wprowadzenie teoretyczne}

Here will be my engineering work.
I will write about the theory of my work, the tools I used, and the results I obtained. I will also write about the conclusions I drew from my work.

\subsection{Theory of the work}

Blablabla

\subsubsection{Theory of something}

%So a paragraph set in 12 point should have a first-line indent of 12–48 points. (Recall that there are 72 points to an inch, so this works out to 0.17–0.67″.)
